# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sentiments expressed in Twitter data. The goal is to categorize tweets into different sentiment classes, providing insights into public opinions, emotions, and trends.

## Tools and Libraries

- [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/): Python library for accessing the Twitter API.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Data manipulation and analysis library.
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/): Natural Language Toolkit for text processing and sentiment analysis.
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/): Machine learning library for building and evaluating models.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): Visualization libraries.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Utilized Tweepy to fetch tweets from Twitter.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the data, including text transformation and handling special characters.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explored data to identify patterns and trends in sentiments.
4. **Model Training:** Implemented machine learning models for sentiment classification.
5. **Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Results:** Presented findings and insights gained from the sentiment analysis.

## Model Performance

- **Naive Bayes:**
  - Accuracy: 0.63
  - Moderate performance with reasonable accuracy.

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**
  - Accuracy: 0.68
  - Improved accuracy, showing strength in decision boundary.

- **Logistic Regression:**
  - Accuracy: 0.69
  - Competitive accuracy, effective in sentiment classification.

- **Random Forest:**
  - Accuracy: 0.68
  - Reliable sentiment classification.

## Conclusion

### Best Performing Model:
- **Logistic Regression** with an accuracy of 0.69.

### Strengths of Logistic Regression:
- Consistent and balanced performance across different sentiment classes.

### Considerations:
- Further exploration of deep learning models for potential improvements.

### Overall:
- The sentiment analysis project successfully employed machine learning models, with Logistic Regression proving to be a reliable choice.

## Next Steps

- Fine-tune models for improved performance.
- Explore deep learning models for complex sentiment analysis tasks.
- Incorporate additional features or external datasets for a comprehensive analysis.
